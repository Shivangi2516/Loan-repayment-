............Formulas used...........

For Monthly Payment-

-  = -PMT(argument1,arguemnt2,argument3)
  -  This function will return the  monthly payment based on the 'Loan amount','Annual 
     Interest Rate' and 'Loan Period in years' which were  the inputs provided in the loan 
     details table.
  -Here PMT is the function used to calculate it.It retuens negative values by default so -ve 
   sign is used before the result.


  - ......Argument 1= Annual Interest Rate/12
         Argument 2 =Loan Period in Years * 12
         Argument 3 = Loam Amount
         ...


 For Total Cost of Loan-

-  =Monthly Payment(EMI) * (Loan Period in Years * 12)
-  This refers to the total amount of money that his to be payed to fully  repay the loan .



For Total Interest Amount-

- =Loan amount- Total cost of loan
- The total interest amount refers to the overall amount of the interest that will be payed on 
  loan. Besides the money that was borrowed,the total amount is the extra cost of borrowing 
  money.
